**How did you organize the team?** \
We knew each other from past classes and are friends, so it was really nice and easy.


**Which tools did you use, if any?** \
We used multiple features offered by Discord to help communicate and better organize ourselves
with the assigned tasks. This includes multiple channels, Polls Bot, Reminders, Announcements,
file sharing, screen sharing, and the voice channels. We also used Google Drive to let us share
and work on documents simultaneously to harness team-work.


**How did you make decisions?** \
Well! We used a discord bot for Polls to decide on all of our decisions. We also used Poll bot to
check which things we needed to get done and which things were done. You can find past
decisions made through the #polls text channel in our Discord.


**How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?** \
We broke the user stories in 3 different categories (one for each of the base users). From there
we decided on what the barebones necessities were for each user and labeled them as high
priority. From there using the ideal features that we got from the presentations, we trickled down the features from more helpful features to not important. Afterwards we reviewed each story and
polish them


**How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for product
decisions?** \
Since our votings were done primarily using the Poll system, we only needed to have one round
to have a consensus for matters such as which project to choose, the choice of stack and software
and other preferences.


**Did you meet in person or online?** \
Due to the geological restrictions of some of our members along with the ongoing pandemic we
held our meetings onlines. Since a few of us lived in different time zones we had to
accommodate by picking a time slot that avoided members waking up very early.


**How frequently did you meet?** \
Starting Monday Sept 28th, we decided to meet everyday at 11 PM for our standup meeting


**What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?** \
Time management to keep meetings not longer than what was intended while also getting
equal participation and attention to each group member.
